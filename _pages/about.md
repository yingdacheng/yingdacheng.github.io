Hello, I am a professor at [Department of Mathematics](https://math.msu.edu/) and [Department of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering](https://cmse.msu.edu/), Michigan State University. My area of research is scientific computing, applied mathematics and data-driven modeling and computation. We are interested in using modern data-driven, reduced order modeling and classical numerical analysis as tools to simulate highly complex and high dimensional multiscale phenonmena arising from science and engineering.

*I am currently recruiting highly motivated Ph.D. students and postdocs. Please send me an email if you are interested.*

My contact information is below.
