Hello, I am currently a professor at [Department of Mathematics](https://math.vt.edu/) and an affliated faculty with [CMDA (Computational Modeling and Data Analytics) program](https://data.science.vt.edu/programs/cmda.html), Virginia Tech. I am on leave from [Department of Mathematics](https://math.msu.edu/) and [Department of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering](https://cmse.msu.edu/), Michigan State University since August 2023.

My area of research is scientific computing, applied mathematics and data-driven modeling and computation. We are interested in using modern data-driven, reduced order modeling and classical numerical analysis as tools to simulate highly complex and high dimensional multiscale phenonmena arising from science and engineering. 

*I am currently recruiting highly motivated Ph.D. students and postdocs to work on multiple projects in scientific computing and reduced order modeling and computations. Please send me an email if you are interested.*
